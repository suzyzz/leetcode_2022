# Description
# There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.
# Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, determine whether the ball could stop at the destination.
# The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The start and destination coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.

# 1.There is only one ball and one destination in the maze.
# 2.Both the ball and the destination exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the same position initially.
# 3.The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example pictures), but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.
# 5.The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and both the width and height of the maze won't exceed 100.

# Example
# Example 1:

# Input:
# map = 
# [
#  [0,0,1,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,1,0],
#  [1,1,0,1,1],
#  [0,0,0,0,0]
# ]
# start = [0,4]
# end = [3,2]
# Output:
# false
# Example 2:

# Input:
# map = 
# [[0,0,1,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,1,0],
#  [1,1,0,1,1],
#  [0,0,0,0,0]
# ]
# start = [0,4]
# end = [4,4]
# Output:
# true
