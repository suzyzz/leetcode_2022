# Description
# Given a knight in a chessboard (a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as barrier) with a source position, find the shortest path to a destination position, return the length of the route.
# Return -1 if destination cannot be reached.

# source and destination must be empty.
# Knight can not enter the barrier.
# Path length refers to the number of steps the knight takes.
# If the knight is at (x, y), he can get to the following positions in one step:

# (x + 1, y + 2)
# (x + 1, y - 2)
# (x - 1, y + 2)
# (x - 1, y - 2)
# (x + 2, y + 1)
# (x + 2, y - 1)
# (x - 2, y + 1)
# (x - 2, y - 1)
# Example
# Example 1:

# Input:
# [[0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0]]
# source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2] 
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# [2,0]->[0,1]->[2,2]
# Example 2:

# Input:
# [[0,1,0],
#  [0,0,1],
#  [0,0,0]]
# source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2] 
# Output:-1
