# There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

# Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

# The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

# Method: recursive 
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        if m == 1 or n == 1:
            return 1
        
        return self.uniquePaths(m - 1, n) + self.uniquePaths(m, n - 1)
      
# Method: Dynamic Programming - Bottom-up
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        d = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]

        for col in range(1, m):
            for row in range(1, n):
                d[col][row] = d[col - 1][row] + d[col][row - 1]

        return d[m - 1][n - 1]
